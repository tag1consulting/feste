# Feste

A GPT-2 style transformer language model implemented from scratch in Rust for educational purposes.

## Why Feste?

Feste is the fool in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, known for his wordplay and wit. The model trains on Shakespeare's complete works and generates text in his style, making the name a natural fit.

## What This Will Be

A complete implementation of a trainable transformer that demonstrates how language models work. The goal is educational clarity, not production performance.

When complete, it will train on Shakespeare's works and generate text in similar style. Every component will be implemented from basic operations without using deep learning frameworks.

## Current Status

Project structure created. Implementation begins with tokenization.
